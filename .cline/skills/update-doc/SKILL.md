# Update doc

When updating documentation, follow this workflow:

- ALWAYS start by informing the user that you are running this skill, saying "SKILL: I WILL UPDATE DOCUMENTATION".

## 1. Check existing README content

- ALWAYS read the existing README content and think about which parts of it should be updated with the task you just implemented.
- Adapt the content to what is relevant for the task you implemented.

## 2. Update the README table of content

- ALWAYS make sure the table of content of the README is still up-to-date: every section should be mentioned, as a link and following the precise hierarchy of sections with indentation.

## 3. Update the README CLI usage section

- ALWAYS check if the real CLI options are documented correctly in the Usage section of the README.md file.
