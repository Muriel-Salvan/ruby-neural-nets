# updating-readme

1. ALWAYS keep the README.md file up-to-date with the new options or architecture changes that are made. Any section of the README should be checked if the content needs to be adapted with any code or test change.
2. ALWAYS keep the table of content of the README.md file up-to-date: any section of the file should be mentioned, as a link and following the precise hierarchy of sections with indentation.
3. ALWAYS document the CLI arguments in the Usage section of the README.md file.

## Usage

This skill should be used anytime a feature has been changed/added/modified in the code, or when the structure of the project has changed.

## Steps

1. Identify all the changes that you think should be documented.
2. Modify the README.md sections content to correctl;y document the identified changes.
3. Make sure the table of content reflects the exact hierarchy of sections in the README.md file. Fix the table of content if it is not the case.
