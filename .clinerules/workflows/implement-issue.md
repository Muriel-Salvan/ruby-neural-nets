ALWAYS start by telling the user "WORKFLOW: I WILL IMPLEMENT AN ISSUE".

1. Ask the USER which Github issue should be implemented.
2. Retrieve the full details of this Github issue (use the github remote to know the Github project URL).
3. Give the details of this issue to the user, with your proposed plan for implementation.
4. Ask the USER to validate this plan. If the USER asks you to modify this plan, take those inputs into account to elaborate another plan and ask again for its validation.
5. When the USER agrees with you on the plan, implement it, following all the rules.
