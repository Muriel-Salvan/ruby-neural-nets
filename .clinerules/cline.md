1. No need to add unit tests for now as this project is just a playground.
2. Every class should be defined in a single file that follows the module and class name in its path, using snake_case for files and paths.
3. README.md file should be always kept up-to-date with the new options or architecture changes that are made.
4. Avoid defining local variables that are used only once. Try to use the variable value directly where it is needed.
