# Development workflow rules

## Git

- ALWAYS stay in the branch that is checked out. NEVER checkout another git branch than the one already checked out.

## Testing

- ALWAYS use the `/skill running-tests` to run tests for this project. NEVER run tests using other commands.
- ALWAYS run all the tests scenarios after any code or test modification that you commit, and also before attempting completion on a task. If any test is failing, identify the root cause and fix it.
