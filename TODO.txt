* Add simple unit tests to check big issues in main frameworks.
* Add test case of the --help CLI.
* Add a way to not dump logs to stdout unless TEST_DEBUG=1 in environment.
* Use GPU to speed-up.
* Glorot is supposed to be not great with ReLU. Try randn*sqrt(2/n[l-1])
* Use Keras or Torch and continue next steps in recognition using convolutional layers, transfer & multitask learning (C3W2), data augmentation, skip connections, RNNs...
* Find techniques that are efficient for hyper parameters tuning - See C2W3
* Add Recall as a metric - See C3W1
